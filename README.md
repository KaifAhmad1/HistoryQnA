# HistoryQnA

HistoryQnA is an innovative project that brings together the strengths of various powerful tools to create a cutting-edge Document-based Question-Answering (QnA) system. By seamlessly integrating `LangChain`, `Pinecone`, and the latest `GPT-4`, this project provides advanced text processing and retrieval capabilities, opening up new possibilities for knowledge extraction.

## Key Features:

### Document Handling
Effortlessly load and split documents from a directory, streamlining the input process for your QnA system.

### Document Embeddings
Harness the power of GPT-4 to generate rich embeddings for your documents, enhancing the understanding and representation of textual information.

### Semantic Search
Implement sophisticated semantic search functionality using Pinecone, facilitating the efficient discovery of relevant documents based on user queries.

### Question-Answering
Leverage LangChain to perform seamless question-answering on the retrieved documents, ensuring a comprehensive and accurate response mechanism.

## How to Use:

1. **Set up Dependencies and Environment Variables:**
   Ensure you have all the required dependencies installed and configure the necessary environment variables to facilitate smooth operation.

2. **Load and Split Documents:**
   Easily load and split your documents from a specified directory, preparing the ground for subsequent processing.

3. **Generate Document Embeddings with GPT-4:**
   Tap into the advanced capabilities of GPT-4 to create powerful embeddings for your documents, enhancing the system's understanding of textual content.

4. **Configure Pinecone for Semantic Search:**
   Set up Pinecone to enable semantic search, allowing users to find relevant documents effortlessly.

5. **Retrieve Similar Documents:**
   Perform semantic searches based on user queries to retrieve documents that closely match the specified criteria.

6. **Create a LangChain Question-Answering Chain:**
   Establish a robust LangChain configuration for seamless question-answering on the documents retrieved through the `load_qa_chain`.

7. **Get Answers for Your Queries:**
   Finally, execute the LangChain Question-Answering chain to obtain accurate and informative answers to your queries based on the retrieved documents.

This project stands as a testament to the potential of combining state-of-the-art technologies for knowledge extraction from document collections. It is poised to become an invaluable tool for information retrieval and various text-based applications.
