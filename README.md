# HistoryQnA
This project combines several powerful tools to create a Document-based Question-Answering (QnA) system. It integrates LangChain, Pinecone, and GPT-4 to provide advanced text processing and retrieval capabilities.

Key Features:

Document Handling: Load and split documents from a directory.
Document Embeddings: Utilize GPT-4 for generating embeddings of documents.
Semantic Search: Implement semantic search using Pinecone, making it easier to find relevant documents.
Question-Answering: Use LangChain to perform question-answering on the retrieved documents.
How to Use:

Set up the required dependencies and environment variables.
Load and split your documents from a directory.
Create document embeddings with GPT-4.
Configure Pinecone for semantic search.
Retrieve similar documents based on a query.
Create a LangChain Question-Answering chain.
Get answers for your queries based on the retrieved documents.
This project offers a powerful solution for extracting knowledge from a collection of documents, making it valuable for information retrieval and text-based applications.
